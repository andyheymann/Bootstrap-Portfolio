							He was a boy. She was a girl. Can I make it anymore obvious? He was a punk. She did ballet. What more can I say? He wanted her. She'd never tell. Secretly she wanted him as well. And all of her friends stuck up their nose. They had a problem with his baggy clothes. He was a skater boy. She said, "See ya later, boy." He wasn't good enough for her. She had a pretty face but her head was up in space. She needed to come back down to earth. Five years from now, she sits at home feeding the baby. She's all alone. She turns on TV and guess who she sees? Skater boy rockin' up MTV. She calls up her friends. They already know. And they've all got tickets to see his show. She tags along, Stands in the crowd, Looks up at the man that she turned down.

She said, "See ya later, boy." He wasn't good enough for her. Now he's a superstar Slammin' on his guitar Does your pretty face see what he's worth? Sorry, girl, but you missed out. Well, tough luck, that boy's mine now. We are more than just good friends. This is how the story ends. Too bad that you couldn't see... See the man that boy could be. There is more than meets the eye, I see the soul that is inside.</p>
